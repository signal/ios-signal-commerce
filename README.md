The Signal Commerce app is a reference app for using the Signal SDK. It is a shopping app the minimally hits a magento service and retrieves the shopping information.  The purchase path is faked out but simulates the type of information that would be sent to signal on a purchase.

Please contact your Signal representative for more information and to help setup a demo of the application.
